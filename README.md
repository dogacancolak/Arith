# Arith
A lossy image compression algorithm that utilizes bitpacking.

## Installation
* Unfortunately, it is not possible to run the project on your machine, since the required libraries are hosted in Tufts servers.

## Usage
* To compress an image, run the executable with appropriate png or pnm image using:
  ```
  40image -c [filename]
  ```
* To decompress a compressed image, run the executable
  ```
  40image -d [filename]
  ```
 
## Algorithm
It is a very algorithm, I recommend to check the [project spec](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40-2011f/homework/arith.html).
